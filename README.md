This is a Symfony integration bundle for [Better Serializer](https://github.com/better-serializer/better-serializer) 
(a general PHP serializer library). 

## Features

Currently only caching backend type, extenral extensions and general naming strategy configuration is implemented. 
Other things will come as soon as they're implemented in 
[Better Serializer](https://github.com/better-serializer/better-serializer).

## Current state

For now, only Symfony 4 integration was tested, but please, feel free to test other versions and don't hesitate to give feedback :)

## Requirements

This library requires PHP 7.1. Maybe it works with older versions, but these are not and won't be supported.

## Usage

The usage is described in the [configuration page](Doc/Configuration.md).

**Contributions are welcome! :)**
